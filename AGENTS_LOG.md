# AGENTS_LOG.md — shared coordination log for AI agents

**If you are an AI agent working in this repository, this file is your
coordination channel. Read it before starting work; append an entry when
you start, finish, hand off, or learn something another agent needs.**

## Protocol

- **Append-only.** Never rewrite or delete existing entries; add new ones
  at the bottom. Newest entry last.
- **Entry header:** `## <UTC ISO timestamp> — <agent/session name> — <machine>`
- **Claim before you run.** Long jobs (Moco solves, sweeps, downloads)
  get an entry *before* launch with the command, PIDs of detached
  processes, expected duration, and output/log paths — so another agent
  (or a resumed session) can tell what is already running instead of
  duplicating or racing it.
- **Close your claims.** When a job finishes or you stop it, log the
  outcome (or note that a chained finisher will handle it).
- **Log decisions and gotchas** another agent would otherwise rediscover;
  move durable ones into CLAUDE.md when they stabilize.
- Machine-generated artifacts (sweep logs, fragments) stay in
  `experiments/` — this file is for narrative coordination, not data.

## 2026-08-29T20:55Z — Claude Code session (windows-main setup + phases) — Windows workstation (32c/64t)

State of the world as of this file's creation:

- **Repo:** branch `windows-main` (Windows counterpart of `main`), all work
  committed and pushed through `ead5793`. Windows setup fixes documented in
  CLAUDE.md (CasADi DLL path fix via `scripts/fix_opensim_dlls_windows.py`;
  LaiArnold geometry symlink stubs replaced with real files).
- **Phase 3 (2D) cadence sweep at 3.0 m/s, metabolic objective:** 5 of 11
  points done sequentially (3.8→3.0 Hz; results in
  `experiments/phase3_2drunning/cadence_sweep_log.json`). Firm findings so
  far: model's energetic optimum is at/above its free choice of 3.8 Hz
  (COT rises monotonically toward human cadence, ~9% by 3.0 Hz), and
  imposing near-human cadence recovers measured contact time (242 vs
  244 ms).
- **RUNNING (claimed):** parallel tail of the sweep — 5 detached solves
  (2.8, 2.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4 Hz; PIDs 27908/25852/31320/28400/30364,
  12 threads each) plus the sequential process finishing 2.9 Hz
  (PID 11236). Watchers: PID 26112 kills 11236 once its 2.9 entry lands;
  chain finisher PID 3528 waits for all six, merges
  `cadence_fragments/*.json` into the sweep log, then launches the full
  3D tracking-seed solve (`experiments/phase3_3drunning/make_seed_3d.py`,
  log `seed3d_full_stdout.log`). Do not start heavy CPU jobs until that
  drains; do not re-run these frequencies.
- **Phase 3 finale (3D) groundwork done:** `runsim.tier3.model3d`
  (Moco-ready LaiUhlrich2022), `runsim.tier3.retarget` (Hamner→LaiUhlrich,
  knee sign flip verified), seed problem validated to 20 IPOPT iterations.
  Known follow-up: model is generic, not subject-scaled.
- **Data:** Hamner subject01/subject02 + RAW_EMG_DATA staged under
  `data/raw/hamner2013/` (1.98 GB, git-ignored). Fukuchi/Van Hooren not
  downloaded on this machine.
- **Convention going forward:** sweeps run PARALLEL BY DEFAULT via
  `runsim.tier3.parallel` (fragments + merge, fair thread split, seed
  each point from the nearest completed solution). Sequential homotopy
  only for first traversal into a new regime.

## 2026-08-29T21:05Z — Claude Code session (coordination test) — Windows workstation

- **test:** verifying the AGENTS_LOG.md watch loop — this session now
  monitors this file for appended entries and is notified of each new
  entry header. If you can read this, the channel works; append your own
  entry below following the protocol at the top.
